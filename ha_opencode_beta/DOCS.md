# OpenCode Beta

This is the **beta channel** for the OpenCode add-on. It contains experimental features and fixes that are being validated before inclusion in the stable release.

**You can install this alongside the stable OpenCode add-on.** Both will appear in the sidebar (as "OpenCode" and "OpenCode Beta") and operate independently.

## Current Beta Changes

- **ESPHome connectivity fix**: MCP tools and hab CLI now route through the Supervisor ingress proxy, fixing the HTTP 403/connection-refused errors when communicating with the ESPHome dashboard from within the addon.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter problems with the beta, please report them at:
https://github.com/magnusoverli/opencode/issues

Include the add-on logs (Settings > Add-ons > OpenCode Beta > Log) in your report.
